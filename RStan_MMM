# RStan MMM

This R code implements a Marketing Mix Model (MMM) to analyze the impact of various marketing channels on sales. Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Loads and preprocesses sales and marketing data
   - Defines variables for media impressions, spending, and control factors

2. Adstock Transformation:
   - Implements adstock functions to account for lagged and diminishing effects of marketing activities

3. Control Model:
   - Builds a base sales model using control variables
   - Uses Stan for Bayesian modeling

4. Marketing Mix Model:
   - Develops a more complex model incorporating media variables
   - Applies adstock transformations and accounts for diminishing returns

5. Diminishing Return Model:
   - Implements Hill function to model diminishing returns for each media channel

6. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
   - Calculates Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and marginal ROAS (mROAS)
   - Decomposes sales contributions by media channel

7. Visualization:
   - Creates various plots to visualize results, including:
     - Media contribution over time
     - Media contribution percentages
     - ROAS and mROAS by channel
     - Fitted Hill functions for each media

8. Optimization Insights:
   - Provides insights into the effectiveness of different marketing channels
   - Offers data for potential budget allocation optimization

This code provides an analysis of marketing effectiveness, allowing marketers to understand the impact of their spending across different channels and make data-driven decisions for future marketing strategies.
